Using your favorite programming language and framework, lib and others:

1. **Create an application.**
-  1.1 create a name for application.
-  1.2 create logo and design and color combination.
-  1.3 the application can have 3 pages.
- 

2. **Application details**
The screen should receive the user through an entry and a button to access the transaction screen
2.1. The screen should receive an input to inform the value (and have validation if the user typed an incorrect character), also an input with the name of the transaction and should have an inputSelect where it will inform if the transaction is of the income or outcome type, and a save button (when clicked will clear the screen for next entries) and finally a balance button that will advance to the next screen
2.2. The balance sheet must contain all the names and their respective titles, all the outcomes and their respective titles and a total showing the entries and exits and the balance.
<br> Obs. **

 Leave instructions on how to run your project and be ready to do it on return from the interview ok, good luck


### Backend

In the backend in NodeJs language, I need to do all the logical part of these transactions, if it is possible to create tables of users and transactions, validate if the user is logged in the system,
and remember, you cannot make exits if there is no balance, if the balance is less than the exit value, trigger an error message warning that you have no balance, it is desirable to use typescript, but it can also be in javascript which will also be valid

_I know, I know ... It seems easy compared to the frontend challenge; but don't be fooled! We expect ** more ** of your responses here! We will evaluate ** how ** you respond and the organization and structure of your response! _

Answer the following questions:
- Suppose you are working with 3 people on a project. What would be the ** ideal ** software development process?


- How do you think an entity relationship diagram would be for _Instagram_?

- Now that you have imagined the ER diagram, ** how ** would you create _Instagram_ from scratch?



That's it! Thanks for doing this test!
